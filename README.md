# üåø Organic Vs ‚ôªÔ∏è Recyclable Waste CNN Classifier

This project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into two distinct categories based on their content:

- **O (Organic):** This class includes images of items that are biodegradable and typically composed of natural materials that can decompose naturally. Examples include food scraps, paper, and wooden objects.

- **R (Recyclable):** This class encompasses images of items that can be processed and reused as raw material for new products. Common examples are plastics, metals, and glass.

The goal of the project is to assist in waste management by automatically sorting waste items into appropriate recycling or composting streams using image recognition technology.

# Dataset 
You can find the **dataset** used for this project on Kaggle: [Waste Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).

All you need to do is take the zip data set, place in the same directory as the jupyter notebook and run everycell (the unzipping is taken care of)
